DESCRIPTION
-----------
The data sets collected in this assignment were collected to analyze how safe the surroundings of Elementary Schools (in terms of road safety) are in the Howard County Area.   
Schools_Elementary.csv
Howard County Maryland (2014). Schools-Elementary [Data File]. Retrieved from https://data.howardcountymd.gov/
This data set contains details of different Elementary schools in the Howard County area with their Names, their Street Addresses and City along with their Zip code. It also contains the Geometric Locations of the schools with their point geometric locations. Each school contains a unique school ID with which any details of the school could be queried. 
Sign_Stop.csv
Howard County Maryland. Sign Stop [Data File]. Retrieved from https://data.howardcountymd.gov/
This data set contains details of Stop Signs around Howard County. It particularly contains a unique ID for each sign, the size of each sign, the specific date when the sign had been installed, the kind of post i.e. the material with which it has been made i.e. wood/metal, the authorities it is maintained by, i.e. the County/School/State, and Point Geometric Locations.
Sign_Warning.csv
Howard County Maryland. Sign Warning [Data File]. Retrieved from https://data.howardcountymd.gov/

 RESEARCH QUESTION
1.	Is it more likely to find a School in an area with more than 10 stop signs?
I would want to see the results reported in the form of maps where each geometric location of either a School, Warning Sign or Stop Sign would clearly be visible. This way we could easily visualize whether the Signs are actually placed near the School locations or not.
The best way to represent the map would be to give different colors to the Signs and Schools, so as to make it easily viewable and to get a good idea of the signs around the Schools.
